// Optimal Approach 

/* INTUITION: We are going to use the Binary Search algorithm to optimize the approach.

The primary objective of the Binary Search algorithm is to efficiently determine the appropriate half to eliminate, thereby reducing the search space by half. It does this by determining a specific condition that ensures that the target is not present in that half.
Upon closer observation, we can recognize that our answer space, represented as [max(arr[]), sum(arr[])], is actually sorted. Additionally, we can identify a pattern that allows us to divide this space into two halves: one consisting of potential answers and the other of non-viable options. So, we will apply binary search on the answer space. */
